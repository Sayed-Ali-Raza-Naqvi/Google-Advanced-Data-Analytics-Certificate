# Project Proposal & PACE Strategy Overview
This repository contains key documents related to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) project, where Automatidata is developing a regression model to estimate taxi fares. Below is an overview of the contents and important points covered in the documents.

## 1. Project Proposal
### Key Points:
- Project Goal: Develop a robust regression model to accurately estimate taxi fares before rides, enhancing transparency and operational efficiency for TLC, drivers, and customers.
- Audience: The primary audience includes the TLC, taxi and limousine drivers, and the New York City government.
- Objectives:
  - Improve fare estimation processes.
  - Reduce disputes over fare amounts.
  - Enhance customer satisfaction.

- Milestones:
  - Data Collection and Cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model Development
  - Model Evaluation and Refinement
  - Final Model Deployment
  - Stakeholders: TLC project managers, data analysis team, IT specialists, and end-users (drivers).

- PACE Workflow: The project is structured using the PACE framework: Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute.

## 2. PACE Strategy Document
### Important Points:
- Plan Stage:

  - Establish Workflow Structure: Organized project tasks and identified resources, deliverables, and stakeholder involvement.
  - Write Project Proposal: Documented the projectâ€™s objectives, scope, timeline, and resource requirements.

- Analyze Stage:
  - Data Exploration & Cleaning: Conducted initial analysis and cleaning to ensure data quality.
  - Compute Descriptive Statistics: Summarized key data characteristics.
  - Hypothesis Testing: Validated assumptions and identified significant data patterns.
  - Evaluate Model: Assessed model performance against success criteria.

- Construct Stage:
  - Build Regression Model: Developed the model using selected features and algorithms.
  - Hypothesis Testing: Revalidated assumptions during model construction.
  - Data Exploration & Cleaning: Additional cleaning as necessary during model building.

- Execute Stage:
  - Communicate Final Insights: Shared final results, visualizations, and recommendations with stakeholders.
  - Visualization Building: Created visualizations to support analysis and communication of insights.
 
## Usage
These documents provide a structured approach to managing and executing the TLC project using the PACE framework. They serve as a guide for all project participants to understand their roles, responsibilities, and the project's overall direction.
