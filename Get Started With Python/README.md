# Automatidata Project: NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Automatidata Project!

In this project, you have been tasked with analyzing the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) data. The goal is to prepare and understand the data, and identify key variables that will be useful for building predictive models.

## Project Structure

The notebook is structured into several parts to ensure that the data is ready for analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing.

### Part 1: Understand the Situation

**Objective**: Prepare to understand and organize the provided taxi cab dataset.

**Tasks**:
1. Import necessary libraries and load the dataset.
2. Prepare the data for inspection and analysis.

### Part 2: Understand the Data

**Objective**: Inspect and analyze the dataset to gain insights and identify key variables.

**Tasks**:
1. **Build DataFrame**:
   - Import libraries.
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Inspect the Data**:
   - Use `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()` to get a summary of the dataset.
   - Address any missing values, data types, and potential anomalies.

3. **Investigate Variables**:
   - Sort and analyze `trip_distance` and `total_amount` to understand their distributions and identify any unusual values.

4. **Payment Type Analysis**:
   - Calculate the average tip amount for credit card payments.
   - Compare with cash payments.

5. **Vendor Analysis**:
   - Determine how many times each vendor ID is represented in the data.
   - Calculate the mean total amount for each vendor.

6. **Passenger Count Analysis**:
   - Filter data for credit card payments.
   - Calculate the average tip amount for each passenger count.

### Part 3: Understand the Variables

**Objective**: Use insights from the data to guide further investigation and build a predictive model.

**Tasks**:
1. Identify the two most helpful variables for predictive modeling:
   - **`trip_distance`**: Important for estimating fare amount.
   - **`passenger_count`**: Provides insights into the size of the trip and can influence the fare.

## Key Findings

1. **Data Inspection**:
   - No null values were found.
   - The dataset includes integer, float, and object data types.
   - Some non-numeric columns may require conversion (e.g., datetime).

2. **Variable Analysis**:
   - `trip_distance` values are on the higher side but within a plausible range for long trips.
   - The `total_amount` shows an unusually high value, which may need further investigation as a potential outlier.

3. **Payment Analysis**:
   - The average tip amount for credit card payments was calculated and compared to cash payments.

4. **Vendor and Passenger Count Analysis**:
   - Vendor ID representation was determined.
   - Mean total amounts were calculated for each vendor.
   - Average tip amounts were calculated for different passenger counts in credit card payments.

## Conclusion

The key variables identified for building a predictive model are `trip_distance` and `passenger_count`. These variables are critical for estimating taxi fares and understanding the scale of service.

## Next Steps

- Prepare the data for visualizations and statistical analysis.
- Develop predictive models using the identified key variables.
