# Automatidata Ride Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes ride data to extract meaningful insights and support strategic decision-making. The focus includes preprocessing the dataset, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and visualizing key metrics.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and organized data, focusing on important variables such as `DOLocationID`.
   - Handled missing values and scaled specific columns as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted analysis to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.
   - Calculated and visualized metrics such as total revenue, ride distances, and mean distances by drop-off location.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations to illustrate the distribution of ride distances and revenue.
   - Plotted mean distances for each drop-off location to understand spatial patterns.

## Insights
- Revealed critical patterns in ride distances and revenue distribution.
- Identified mean distances by drop-off location, helping to understand operational efficiencies.
